1) 10.times { |x| puts ' '*x + "The Flintstones Rock!" }

2) puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}" 
  OR
  puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

3) def factors(number)
  divisor = number
  factors = []
  while divisor > 0
    factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
    divisor -= 1
  end 
  factors
end

4) the changes made by << will carry outside of the method, mutating the caller

5) The "limit" variable can't be accessed within the method unless it is directly passed.
  Passing the variable as an argument to the mehtod would fix this problem.

6) 34

7) The demographic data would be changed because while assignment is non-mutating, indexed assignment
within a hash is.
