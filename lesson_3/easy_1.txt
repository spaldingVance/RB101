1) The code would output:
  1
  2
  2
  3
  4 
because uniq! is immutable

2)
- ! can either mean "not" or it can represent that a method is mutable
- ?, when placed at the end of a method name, usually means that the method
  will return a boolean value

    what is != and where should you use it?- 
      - This operator means "not equals" and should be used as a conditional
    put ! before something, like !user_name
      - Here, ! would mean "not", which would return trtue if user_name == false
    put ! after something, like words.uniq!
      - ! is used to imply that uniq! mutates the caller
    put ? before something
      - 
    put ? after something
      - This would usually be used to show that a method returns a boolean
    put !! before something, like !!user_name
      - This would show True is user_name was true

3) advice.gsub!('important', 'urgent')

4) - numbers.delete_at(1) deletes the element at index 1
  - numbers.delete(1) deletes all instances of the number 1

5) (10..100).include?(42)
    => True

6) famous_words += "Four score and "
  "Four score and " << famous_words

7) 42

8) flintstones.flatten!

9) flintstones.assoc("Barney")
